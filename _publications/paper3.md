What are the consequences of gender quotas? This paper investigates the impact of Taiwan's gender quota rule in local council elections. The findings show that the quotas not only increased women’s descriptive representation but also elevated the presence of another political group: dynastic politicians. Utilizing a regression discontinuity design based on the quota thresholds, I provide causal evidence of these shifts in representation. The interplay between a candidate-centered electoral system (SNTV-MMD) and a one-quarter gender quota has improved the electoral viability of dynastic candidates and incentivized major parties to recruit from political families, thereby reinforcing their dominance in local politics. An analysis of legislative speeches and bill proposals further reveals that the frequency of women-related policy demands has increased in constituencies with quotas. Under certain conditions, dynastic politicians are even more likely to advocate for women’s rights, challenging the conventional view that dynasties are less supportive of such policies.
