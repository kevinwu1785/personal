It has been demonstrated that institutions play a crucial role in strategic voting. While most studies compare democratic systems across different countries, few investigate institutional changes within a single democracyâ€”especially in non-parliamentary systems. This study examines the causal relationship between institutional reform and strategic voting, using electoral data from before and after Taiwan's 2008 parliamentary electoral reform. The reform involved a transition from a multi-member district system to a single-member district system, while the local council election system remained unchanged, enabling the use of a difference-in-differences framework. The findings indicate that strategic voting intensified after the reform, with votes increasingly concentrated on candidates from the two major parties. Additionally, individual-level survey data reveal that many voters quickly adjusted their party affiliations in response to the reform.
