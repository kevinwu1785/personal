How do members of Congress secure positions on influential committees or attain leadership roles? While this question has received substantial scholarly attention, the role of financial contributions to party organizations—what we term a “party tax”—has received relatively limited recent analysis. We revisit this mechanism by examining member contributions as indicators of both willingness and capacity to support party goals financially. Our findings suggest that such contributions are particularly consequential for members occupying elite committee and leadership positions, consistent with theories of concentrated institutional power. These effects are especially pronounced among Republicans, highlighting partisan differences in how financial resources are leveraged for institutional advancement. Using change-point analysis, we demonstrate that the formal institutionalization of party dues produced meaningful shifts, particularly among non-leadership members, rather than simply codifying existing practices. To address causal concerns, we apply coarsened exact matching, which shows that members who ascend to more powerful positions subsequently increase their contributions to party leaders—reinforcing a feedback loop in which financial supporters are rewarded with desirable placements. Together, these results underscore a strategic process in which monetary contributions facilitate access to institutional power and further entrench partisan resource flows.
