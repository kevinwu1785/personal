This project investigates the long-term effects of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan (1895–1945), aiming to broaden our understanding of colonial legacies beyond the context of Western empires. While social scientists have extensively studied the colonial impacts on economic and political development, most research centers on Western powers. This study focuses on Taiwan under Japanese rule, where authorities implemented two distinct administrative systems: police-led governance in indigenous areas and conventional bureaucratic administration elsewhere. These systems were divided by a clearly defined boundary, creating a quasi-experimental setting to compare adjacent villages that differed primarily in their mode of administration. We test the hypothesis that police administration—characterized by intensive social control and direct engagement with the population—led to higher Japanese-language proficiency, increased school enrollment, and a deeper alignment with centralized authority. These effects may have persisted after colonial rule, manifesting in greater political support for the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan’s ruling party post-colonization. The lasting influence is attributed to the police system’s role in fostering compliance with authority and habituation to state governance.
